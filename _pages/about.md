* I am a software engineer at Google. Prior to that, I earned CS Ph.D. from Georgia Tech, where I designed bottom-up adversarial approaches (in contrast to top-down security policies) to improve the robustness and security of software/ML systems. 


* I Published 10+ software/ML security research works at top-tier conferences including IEEE S&P, USENIX SEC, BlackHat USA, etc. Also, I am member of Program Committees at premium AI conferences including NeurIPS and ACM WWW.
