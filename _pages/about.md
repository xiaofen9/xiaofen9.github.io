* I am a machine learning researcher working at Palo Alto Networks. Prior to that, I earned CS Ph.D. from Georgia Tech, where I designed adversarial approaches to improve the robustness and security of machine learning/software systems. 


* I Published 10+ ML/systems security research works at top-tier conferences including IEEE S&P, USENIX SEC, BlackHat USA, etc. Also, I am member of Program Committees at premium AI conferences including NeurIPS and ACM WWW.
